1 function for checking guests in and seeing availibility of rooms
would use lists and if loops?
1 function for charging guests
use print for something like "this room is x dollars"
ask "do you agree to the price?"
if they dont agree then kick them out
1 function for checking multiple rooms out, maybe incorporate into the checking guests in?
